don't use GET to ladderEdit.cgi


winning/rising streak

wrapper page around graph
don't assume the games are in date order in the data-file

player page including:
  make the graph smaller
  highest/lowest ever, most significant loss/gain
  last played datetime

continue speculative games into player.cgi and graphs etc.
graph for multiple players should plot data over the same period of time not the same number of games (still specify that time as the latest point in time that everyone has played a given number of games) 

show activity (fade people out of the table for inactivity?)

show excluded games in grey

min/max line bug on single players graph.
distribution of skill graph
directed graph of skill movements
exclusion (exclude/unexclude a player)

hit counter in footer

plot /gameNo as well as /time
when plotting more than 1 player, plot total score as well (i.e. how is the rim teams combined score doing?)
alternatively, show teams as pseudo players.

refactor per player stats
